    "I made this as an example of my knowledge of Next.js as all the other examples I have are not public. In order to make this useful, I decided to make this example explain a bit about me. This is why I used Next.js instead of <span class='code'>create-react-app</span> which would have been a bit more straightforward for an app of this size.",
    "When it comes to React and Next.js I am completely self taught so I am always ironing out the kinks in the way I write applications. Luckily, React is pretty nice for doing things your own way"

        "I wanted to use API routes with this project but I had some trouble running them on <span class='code'>now</span>. They did get deployed but I was getting some other problems so to simplify the whole thing I just pull the JSON directly from my host on GitHub. I didnt really need to transform the data anyway so API routes would have just have been a middle man for the data in the end.",
        "I also considered AMP âš¡ for this but there were a few problems that I was strapped for time to fix so it is a task for another day. I was able to do some other optimisations though such as using webp for the images which is much more straightforward",
        "I did this project mostly over a weekend so, although I tried to make this as true to my professional development process as possible, I was a bit strapped for time so there may be a few <span class='italics'>dirty hacks</span>",
        "I would like to eventually add translations to the site and alternate themes however, I think I will leave that all for another day "
